## Metadata

🔭 I’m currently working on 'All the things **you** are' 🤷‍♂️

🌱 I’m currently learning Web3 concepts: decentralization and the blockchain (Bitcoin for now) via BTrust Builders and the Bitcoin Dev Project. 

🌱 I'm interested in how networks work, cybersecurity, and AI related subjects such as Neural networks and Computer Vision

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on apps that utilize Rust, Web Assembly, Artificial Intelligence or Web3 related tech.

⚡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I teach kids to code, and some music lessons too. Passing on knowledge to the next generation is the greatest gift and a privilege.

⚡ Chess is awesome. Taking baby steps via [lichess][lichess]

⚡ La langue française est incroyable. Je n'ai jamais réussi à comprendre pourquoi j'aime le français, mais je l'aime beaucoup.
