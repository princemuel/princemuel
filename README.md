## Metadata

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Notezone**, a Progressive Web App for taking notes in text and markdown

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web3 concepts such as decentralization and the blockchain. I'm also interested in how networks work, cybersecurity, and AI related subjects e.g Machine Learning, Data Science etc

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on apps that utilize Web Assembly, or AI and Blockchain related tech.

âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from my day-to-day activities, in my spare time, I also teach kids to code.
Passing on knowledge to the next generation is the greatest gift and a privilege.

### Tooling

- Languages: Rust, Python, Javascript, Typescript
- Design: Figma, Canva
- To be continued _(I'm tired ðŸ˜„ )_
