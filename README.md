## Metadata

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Notezone**, a Progressive Web App for taking notes in text and markdown

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web3 concepts such as decentralization and the blockchain (Bitcoin for now) via BTrust Builders and the Bitcoin Dev Project. 

ðŸŒ± I'm also interested in how networks work, cybersecurity, and AI related subjects such as Neural networks and Computer Vision

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on apps that utilize Rust, Web Assembly, Artificial Intelligence or Web3 related tech.

âš¡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I also teach kids to code.
Passing on knowledge to the next generation is the greatest gift and a privilege.

âš¡ I also love chess, though I've have never been able to figure out how to get to an endgame with enough pieces left to actually win.
